> One of the main lessons we’ve learned is that **journalists have not been fully using all of the tools that are now available to us.** For decades, the traditional article — be it a 700-word news article or an 1,800-word feature — has dominated newspaper and magazine journalism. Every other way to convey information — photographs, charts, maps, illustrations, you name it — has generally been placed in the role of satellite, dependent on an article and orbiting around it.
